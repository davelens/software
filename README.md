# Mac OS X software installer

This is a bootstrap installer for most of the software I use on a daily basis. It makes heavy use of Homebrew formulas.

# Disclaimer

This installer is tested on a fresh Mac OS X Yosemite install and works beautifully for me. I take no responsability whatsoever if your mac (or you o.O) suffers damage in any way after using this bootstrap installer.

# Usage
	./install.sh
